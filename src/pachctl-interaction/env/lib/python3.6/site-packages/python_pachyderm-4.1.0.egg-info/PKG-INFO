        Official Python Pachyderm client. Created by [kalugny](https://github.com/kalugny) (formerly kalugny/pypachy), and now maintained by Pachyderm Inc.
        
        This library provides the autogenerated gRPC/protobuf code for Pachyderm, along with a higher-level and more pythonic `Client` class. See the [API docs](https://pachyderm.github.io/python-pachyderm/python_pachyderm.m.html).
        
        ## Installation
        
        ```bash
        pip install python-pachyderm
        ```
        
        ## A Small Taste
        
        Here's an example that creates a repo and adds a file:
        
        ```python
        import python_pachyderm
        client = python_pachyderm.Client()
        client.create_repo('test')
        with client.commit('test', 'master') as c:
            client.put_file_bytes(c, '/dir_a/data.txt', b'DATA')
        
        ```
        
        For more sophisticated examples, [see the examples directory](https://github.com/pachyderm/python-pachyderm/tree/master/examples).
        
        ## Versioning
        
        Prior to python-pachyderm 2.0, this library's versioning synced with pachyderm's core versioning; e.g. version 1.8.5 of this library synced with 1.8.5 of pachyderm core. python-pachyderm 2.0 onwards uses semver instead, so versions are not tied to pachyderm core. This was done for two reasons:
        
        1. Sometimes this library makes breaking or backwards-incompatible changes, which aren't properly conveyed by revision changes.
        2. Pachyderm core is stable enough that most features of this library will work for disparate versions of pachyderm clusters. To help ensure this, this library's CI tests against several versions of pachyderm core.
        
        However, if for whatever reason you need to know which version of pachyderm core a version of python-pachyderm was built with, consult `CHANGELOG.md`. As a broad rule of thumb, we recommend working with the latest version of both pachyderm core and python-pachyderm where possible.

        ### Getting started
        
        To run tests, clone the repo, [install jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/), then run:
        
        ```
        make init
